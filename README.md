Repository for the SURE Robotic Arm 4DOF Project 

Project Title: Autonomous 4 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) Robotic Arm for Chess Piece
Manipulation

Abstract:
This project focuses on building a simple robotic arm that can
recognize and move chess pieces on a board. The system will use
a basic camera for detecting the board and pieces, a pre-trained
chess engine for decision-making, and motorized joints to
execute moves. The goal is to develop a functional prototype,
ensuring ease of implementation while maintaining accuracy in
piece movement.
Project Objectives:
• Design & Assemble the Robotic Arm: Build a 4-DOF
robotic arm with a gripper capable of picking and placing chess pieces.
• Integrate Computer Vision & Chess Engine: Use a camera to detect board positions and
integrate a chess engine (e.g., Stockfish) for move decisions.
• Implement Motion Control & Automation: Develop a control system that allows the arm
to execute legal chess moves accurately.
Brief Methodology:
• Hardware Setup: Assemble a 4-DOF robotic arm with servo motors and a gripper.
• Computer Vision Integration: Use OpenCV to detect the chessboard and piece positions.
• Chess Engine Integration: Connect the system to a lightweight chess engine (Stockfish or
Python Chess library) for decision-making.
• Motion Planning: Use inverse kinematics and basic trajectory planning to ensure smooth
and precise movement of chess pieces.
• Testing & Optimization: Conduct trial games to refine movement accuracy and
responsiveness.
Additional information:
DOF (Degrees of Freedom) refers to the number of independent movements a robotic system or
mechanical structure can perform. In robotics, each DOF represents a joint or axis along which the
robot can move.
For example, a 4-DOF robotic arm typically has: Base Rotation (Yaw): The arm rotates left or right.
Shoulder Movement (Pitch): The arm moves up and down. Elbow Movement (Pitch): The forearm
bends to extend or retract. Wrist Movement (Pitch or Roll): The gripper adjusts to pick and place
objects.
Number of students: A minimum of 5 students and a maximum of 7 students are required to
successfully complete this project within the given timeframe
